# Secure Device Onboard (SDO) out-of-the-box demo

**NOTE**: The Protocol Reference Implementation (PRI) out-of-the-box demo is provided solely to demonstrate the operation of the Secure Device Onboard protocol and interworking of the PRI Demo Device, Demo Owner, Demo Rendezvous service, with use of Supply Chain Tools for device configuration.   _This demo is not recommended for use in any production capacity._  Appropriate security measures with respect to key-store management and configuration management should be considered while performing production deployment of any Secure Device Onboard component.

The out-of-the-box demo contains scripts and configuration files to run SDO services.

The SDO out-of-the-box demo is organized according to the following directory structure:

    demo
     └──|
        ├── device       : Demo Device
        ├── owner        : Demo Owner
        └── rendezvous   : Demo Rendezvous service

## Packages required for the Ubuntu* 18.04 system

    $ sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk-headless

## Running the demo on a single machine

The demo consists of running a Rendezvous service, an Ownership service, and
a simulated device in three separate terminal windows.

To begin the demo, open four separate terminal windows:

Terminal #1: Start the Rendezvous Server.

    $ cd rendezvous
    $ ./rendezvous

Terminal #2: Register the voucher for TO0.

    $ cd owner
    $ ./to0client vouchers/1fae14fb-deca-405a-abdd-b25391b9d932.json

The client would perform TO0 registration for the ownership vouchers present
within 'vouchers' folder. The TO0 registration has a timeout value, hence
to0client needs to be run periodically.

Terminal #3: Start the Ownership service.

    $ cd owner
    $ ./owner

Terminal #4: Start the simulated device.

    $ cd device
    $ ./device

When the demo finishes, the log files would be avaialble in respective folders.

## Default key-types in the demo

* ECDSA NIST-256

# Configuring the demo

Different properties used in the demo are specified in respective
application.properties file. A brief description for each of these fields are
provided within the configuration file. For more details, please refer to the
file application.properties.sample provided under 'pri' folder in source
package.

# Working with new Ownership Voucher/Ownership Credentials pairs

New Ownership Vouchers/Ownership Credential pair can be generated using
'SupplyChainTools'. Follow the related user guide to generate the new SDO
credentials.

* The generated Ownership voucher file should be copied to owner/vouchers
  folder.
* In device/application.properties, com.intel.sdo.device.credentials field
  should be updated with the path of generated Ownership Credential file.
* While running to0client, path of generated Ownership voucher should be
  provided as arguement.
